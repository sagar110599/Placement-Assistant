4,"Three people A, B and C working individually can finish a job in 10, 12 and 20 days respectively. They decided to work together but after 2 days, A left the work and after another one day, B also left work. If they got two lacs collectively for the entire work, find the difference of the highest and lowest share.",A,"Let the total work be LCM(10, 12, 20) = 60 units
 Efficiency of A = 60/10 = 6 units / day
 Efficiency of B = 60/12 = 5 units / day
 Efficiency of C = 60/20 = 3 units / day
Since the number of working days are different for each person, 
the share of each will be calculated in the ratio of the units of work done.
Now, A works for 2 days and B works for 3 days.
 Work done by A = 2 x 6 = 12 units
 Work done by B = 3 x 5 = 15 units
 Work done by C = 60 – 12 – 15 = 33 units
Therefore, ratio of work done = 12:15:33 = 4:5:11
So, A’s share = (4/20) x 2, 00, 000 = Rs 40, 000
B’s share = (5/20) x 2, 00, 000 = Rs 50, 000
C’s share = (11/20) x 2, 00, 000 = Rs 1, 10, 000
Therefore, difference of the highest and lowest share 
= Rs 1,10,000 – 40,000 = Rs 70,000",70000,11000,40000,80000,,,

So according to the question, the market price will be = 100*0.6 = 60
